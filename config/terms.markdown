## About our terms of service


Welcome to Global Trade Payment Services Inc (the "Company" or "GTPS"). We developed this contract-escrow service (the “Service”) to make it easy for you to pay and receive large payments locally and internationally so that you and your customers can focus on products.

We have tried to draft these Merchant Terms of Service to be readable to people like us. Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make it a very difficult task. So, should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how we do things at GTPS, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Below is a quick description of the sections in this Agreement, but there are important details in the whole document, so if you are a legal troublemaker, you should read it.

## The GTPS Service

We provide you with software and a service to process online your bank-based escrow payments; we will respect and protect your privacy, data and personal information. You run your business, service your customers, protect your customers’ data, report & pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations.

## Registering for GTPS

You provide us with basic information about your company; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by us or our payment processors). You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or we otherwise must decline to offer you the service.

## Receiving your Funds from Escrow Transactions

We pay out the amount paid us by the payment party to the service party (minus our fees), at a schedule as dictated by the written, signed, and locked contract on our site. (Payouts happen within the day as dictated by the contract with consideration to bank holidays and other such external circumstances). We do not hold your funds longer than specified by the terms of your individual contract. You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks).

## Termination and Other Legal Terms

Except during the locked phase of your contract, we can terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you do something bad). You can also terminate anytime, except, once again, during the locked phase of your contract. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not alter your liability for owed payments or related chargebacks.

## GTPS Terms of Service

The Terms and Conditions described here constitute a legal agreement (“Agreement”) between the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the “Merchant” on the Service registration page (sometimes referred to as “you,” “your”, “user”), Global Trade Payment Services, Inc. (“GTPS”).

## Section A: The GTPS Service

#### 1. Our Role

Our role is that of a third party escrow agent. At a certain point as specified in your individually drafted contracts between you and another party, some mutually agreed to amount of funds will be transfered to our bank account. We will hold this fund in escrow until such point that the contract mutually agreed to between you and the other party dictates that the funds should be released. At which time, the funds will be released to the appropriate party's bank account.

#### 2. Our Software

We provide the GTPS API and other software to enable you to use the Service. We reserve the right to require you install or update any and all software updates to continue using the Service. Our Service also includes software to help you manage recurring and subscription billing charges for your products and services. It is your responsibility to obtain any other affilated partys' consent as necessary by the terms of your individual contract.

#### 3. Authorization for Handling of Funds

By accepting this agreement, you authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your contract agreement dictate the funds should be released. You further authorize GTPS to instruct any of our BANKS on how your transaction settlement funds should be disbursed to you (such as by ACH credit transaction or sending you a paper check payable to you or wire transfer) and the timing of such disbursements. Settlement funds will be held in a deposit account at our BANKS pending disbursement of the funds to you in accordance with the terms of this contract. You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held by our BANKS pending settlement to your designated bank settlement account, that you have no right to direct that deposit account, and that you may not assign any interest in the deposit account at BANK OF AMERICA. We may periodically make available to you information in the GTPS management dashboard regarding anticipated settlement amounts received on your behalf from the Card Networks and are being held pending settlement. This settlement information does not constitute a deposit or other obligation of GTPS or our BANKS to you. This settlement information reflected in the GTPS management dashboard is for reporting and informational purposes only, and you are not entitled to, and have no ownership or other rights in settlement funds, until such funds are credited to your designated bank settlement account. Your authorizations set forth herein will remain in full force and effect until your GTPS Account is closed or terminated.

#### 4. Payment Methods

GTPS will only process bank information that you have provided. You are solely responsible for verifying the legality of your funds and bank. GTPS does not guarantee or assume any liability for transactions authorized and completed which may later be reversed or chargedback (see Chargebacks below). You are solely responsible for all reversed or chargedback transactions, regardless of the reason for, or timing of, the reversal or chargeback. GTPS may add or remove one or more types of accepted payment methods at any time. If we do so we will use reasonable efforts to give you prior notice of the removal.

#### 5. Customer Service

We will provide you with customer service to resolve any issues relating to your GTPS Account, your payment processing and use of our software, and the distribution of funds to your designated bank settlement account. You, and you alone, are responsible for providing service to your customers for any and all issues related to your products and services, including but not limited to issues arising from the processing of customers’ credit cards, account information, etc. through the Service.

#### 6. Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your products and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with your use of the Service (“Taxes”). It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the proper tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process and merchants to which we provide card payment services.

Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations are required to file an information return with the IRS for each calendar year, reporting all payment card transactions and third-party network transactions with merchants occurring in that calendar year. You acknowledge that we will report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of the payments you receive each calendar year as required by law.

#### 7. Your Data Security Obligations

You are fully responsible for the security of data on your site or otherwise in your possession. You agree to comply with all applicable state and federal laws and rules in connection with your collection, security and dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or transaction information (defined as “Data”) on your site. You agree that at all times you shall be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) and the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), as applicable. The steps you will need to take to comply with PCI-DSS and PA-DSS when using GTPS will vary based on your implementation. For more information about implementing GTPS, please refer to our documentation. If we believe it is necessary based on your implementation and request it of you, you will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing your compliance with PCI DSS and/or PA DSS if requested by us. You also agree that you will use only PCI compliant service providers in connection with the storage, or transmission of Data defined as a cardholder’s account number, expiration date, and CVV2. You must not store CVV2 data at any time. Information on the PCI DSS can be found on the PCI Council’s website. It is your responsibility to comply with these standards.

#### 8. Security and Fraud Controls

GTPS is responsible for protecting the security of Data in our possession and will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in our servers from unauthorized access and accidental loss or modification. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide this personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk. We recommend you review our Privacy Policy, which will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us.

GTPS may provide or suggest security procedures and controls intended to reduce the risk to you of fraud (“Security Controls”). These Security Controls may include processes or applications that are developed by GTPS or by third parties. You agree to review all Security Controls and choose those that are appropriate for your business to protect against unauthorized transactions and, if necessary, use other procedures and controls not provided by us. Disabling or failing to properly use Security Controls increases your exposure to unauthorized bank transactions. Keep in mind that you are responsible for the use of lost or stolen data that is used to purchase products or services from your business. GTPS will not be liable for losses resulting from use of lost or stolen data with the Service.

#### 9. Audit Right

If we believe that a security breach or compromise of data has occurred, we may require you to have a third-party auditor that is approved by us conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to us and our banking partners.

#### 10. Your Privacy

Your privacy and the protection of your information are very important to us. You acknowledge that you have received, read in full, and agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy, linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which contains your consent to our collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information as well as other matters. The Privacy Policy also explains how and for what purposes we collect, use, retain, disclose, and safeguard the information you provide to us. You specifically consent to the fulfillment of the obligations related to the listing by us or our payment processor and to the listing itself and you waive and hold harmless us or our payment processor from all claims and liabilities you may have as a result of such reporting.

#### 11. Privacy of Others

You represent to GTPS that you are and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable privacy laws. You further represent that you have obtained all necessary rights and consents under applicable law to disclose to GTPS – or allow GTPS to collect, use, retain, and disclose – any Data that you provide to us or authorize us to collect, including information that we may collect directly from your end users via cookies or other means. 

#### 12. Restricted Use

You are required to obey all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Service (for example, those governing financial services, consumer protections, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, or false advertising).

#### 13. Suspicion of Unauthorized or Illegal Use

We reserve the right to not authorize or settle any transaction you submit which we believe is in violation of this Agreement, any other GTPS agreement, or exposes you, other GTPS users, our processors or GTPS to harm, including but not limited to fraud and other criminal acts. You are hereby granting us authorization to share information with law enforcement about you, your transactions, or your GTPS Account if we reasonably suspect that your use of GTPS has been for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose.

#### 14. Disclosures and Notices

You agree that GTPS can provide disclosures and notices regarding the Service to you by posting such disclosures and notices on our website, emailing them to the email address listed in your GTPS Account, or mailing them to the address listed in your GTPS Account.

#### 15. References to Our Relationship

#### 16. Other GTPS Services

From time to time we may offer you additional features or services (“Additional Services”), such as GTPS Listings or international services, which may be subject to additional or different terms of service. As with this Service, you may not use these Additional Services unless you agree to the applicable terms of service. Except where expressly stated otherwise, your use of Additional Services will have no impact on the applicability of this Agreement to the Service.

No party will be liable for delays in processing or other nonperformance caused by such events as fires, telecommunications failures, utility failures, power failures, equipment failures, labor strife, riots, war, terrorist attack, nonperformance of our vendors or suppliers, acts of God, or other causes over which the respective party has no reasonable control, except that nothing in this section will affect or excuse your liabilities and obligations under Section 10, including without limitation for Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fines, fees, refunds or unfulfilled products and services.

#### 17. Responding to Legal Process

GTPS may respond to and comply with any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order (“Legal Process”) that we believe to be valid. We may deliver or hold any funds or, subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy, any information as required under such Legal Process, even if you are receiving funds on behalf of third parties. Where permitted, we will use reasonable efforts to provide you notice of such Legal Process by sending a copy to the email address we have on file for you. GTPS is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our complying with Legal Process.

#### 18. Entire Agreement

This Agreement and all policies and procedures that are incorporated herein by reference constitute the entire agreement between you, GTPS, and BANK OF AMERICA with respect to the provision of the Service. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any other GTPS agreement or policy relating to the subject matter herein, this Agreement shall prevail. Except as expressly provided herein, these terms and conditions describe the entire liability of GTPS, BANK OF AMERICA, and our vendors and suppliers (including processors), set forth your exclusive remedies with respect to the Service, and define your access and use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement (or portion thereof) is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
